The company’s shares are set to debut on the stock exchanges tomorrow, marking a milestone for the company. The IPO, which raised Rs 7,278 crore, was subscribed 28 times, drawing bids worth nearly Rs 1 lakh crore. Despite a volatile grey market, investor interest has been healthy during the bidding.In his note, Bansal said he didn't dream of ringing a bell one day but wished to solve one simple, human problem, that millions of people in India couldn't see clearly. He recalled how one of Lenskart’s first customers, a school teacher, broke into tears after wearing her first pair of glasses in years.That emotional moment, he said, became the soul of Lenskart, to help people see clearly and live fully.He went on to write: \"Sometimes, it takes one person’s smile to remind you why you began\", he reflected on the company's obsession with customer experience, from the smallest store details to the speed of service. Excellence has no geography. Whether it's Patna or Tokyo, the standard must be the same.\"Even today, Bansal said, he personally reviews store feedback weekly. \"We didn’t start with a grand plan, but with a belief that we could wow customers through something as simple and powerful as sight.\"He reminded investors that Lenskart wasn't built to chase valuations, but to reach people, from Delhi’s heart to the smallest towns in the Northeast. In an indirect reference to the company's profits, Bansal said that the bottomline is oxygen that keeps the company alive, but a higher purpose is breath.Reflecting on India’s entrepreneurial transformation, Bansal recalled returning from Microsoft at a time when building global Indian companies was still a dream. \"I came back with a dream, that India can build companies that stand shoulder to shoulder with the best in the world and still carry India in their DNA.\"Comparing the journey to Flipkart’s sale to Walmart, he called that era bittersweet -- India celebrated, yet was still selling its dreams early. \"Lenskart was born out of that dream, that India can build global institutions, not just startups.\"\"Tomorrow isn't about looking back, it's about beginning again,\" Bansal said, adding that the IPO bell wouldn’t sound like victory, but like a reminder \"to keep building, keep innovating, keep serving, keep dreaming.\"Also read: Lenskart GMP crashes to zero, wiping out all pre-listing buzz ahead of Monday debut \"We started Lenskart to help India see better. Now we build so the world can see through India, an India that designs with conscience, builds with excellence, and leads with heart.\"Lenskart sought a valuation of around Rs 70,000 crore for its IPO, which analysts termed a bit overpriced. However, most brokerages had recommended subscribing to the IPO for the long term, given the strong industry tailwind seen in the future.",

The GMP, which had peaked at Rs 108, implying a listing pop of over 25% before the announcement of the IPO, has now collapsed, signalling that the counter may see a flat or muted listing despite its healthy subscription.Lenskart’s Rs 7,278 crore IPO, comprising a Rs 600 crore fresh issue and a Rs 6,678 crore offer for sale, was subscribed a decent 28 times overall, drawing bids worth nearly Rs 1 lakh crore. The strong response was driven by institutional investors, with the QIB portion subscribed 45 times, while retail and HNI categories were also fully booked.However, the Street has grown cautious over valuation concerns, a factor that may now be weighing on sentiment. At the upper end of the price band of Rs 402 per share, the IPO valued Lenskart at a steep FY25 EV/EBITDA multiple of over 50x, far higher than established listed peers in the consumer and retail space.Adding to the pressure, brokerage Ambit Capital initiated coverage with a \"Sell\" rating just before the listing, citing stretched valuations and modest return ratios.\"We expect Lenskart to deliver 20% revenue CAGR over FY25–28 led by India expansion and rising global scale. However, at 55x FY28 EV/EBITDA, the stock trades at a 15–30% premium to Trent and Nykaa despite a lower RoCE of 9% versus peers' 35–40%,\" Ambit said. It set a target price of Rs 337, indicating a downside of about 16% from the issue price.While the company has delivered strong topline growth, revenues rose 32.5% to Rs 6,653 crore in FY25, a chunk of its Rs 297 crore FY25 profit came from a one-time gain of Rs 167 crore linked to the Owndays acquisition. Adjusted for this, the normalized profit drops to Rs 130 crore, translating to a net margin of just 1.96%.Analysts say that while Lenskart’s long-term story remains compelling, driven by its leadership in India’s underpenetrated eyewear market and omnichannel strategy, the stock’s short-term outlook looks muted.If the stock lists flat, it would reflect a cooling of sentiment that had pushed grey market trades to frothy levels earlier. Long-term investors, however, may still look to hold, given the company’s structural growth potential in India’s expanding eyewear and optical retail market.",

After one of 2025’s most sought-after consumer IPOs , the company’s grey market premium (GMP), a key gauge of listing expectations, has plunged nearly 94% from Rs 108 to around Rs 6.5 per share, indicating a modest 1.6% premium over the issue price of Rs 402.The sharp fall in the GMP suggests that traders in the unofficial market are turning cautious ahead of listing. Analysts said sentiment has softened amid valuation fatigue and a pullback in secondary markets, even as the public issue drew an overwhelming response.Lenskart’s Rs 7,278 crore IPO, one of the largest consumer listings of the year, received bids worth over Rs 1 lakh crore, translating to a 28.3 times overall subscription. The institutional segment led the rally, with Qualified Institutional Buyers (QIBs) subscribing 45 times, underscoring strong confidence from both foreign and domestic funds.Non-institutional investors subscribed 18 times, while the retail portion saw 7.5 times participation, impressive given the high ticket size and valuation concerns. Exchange data showed that investors bid for 281 crore shares against 9.97 crore shares on offer, reflecting robust demand despite a jittery broader market.While analysts remain optimistic about Lenskart’s long-term prospects, many believe near-term listing gains could be limited.“Valuation of Lenskart seems stretched and hence listing gain is likely to be muted. However, looking at the robust business model, the company is well placed to encash on the fast-growing domestic organized eyeglasses market,” SBI Securities said.At the upper price band, Lenskart is valued at 10.1x FY25 EV/Sales and 68.7x EV/EBITDA—multiples that leave little room for short-term upside. Still, analysts note that profitability metrics have been improving, with EBITDA margins rising from 7% in FY23 to 14.7% in FY25. The Street will be closely watching whether this trajectory sustains post-listing.Behind the valuation chatter lies the growth story that drew investors in. Lenskart has built one of India’s most recognizable consumer brands through its omnichannel model, technology-led design, and vertically integrated manufacturing.The company operates over 2,700 stores globally, including 2,000 in India, and has expanded into Singapore, UAE, and the US. In FY25, revenue surged 32% CAGR over two years to Rs 6,653 crore, while EBITDA grew 3.7 times to Rs 971 crore. It also turned profitable in FY25 with a PAT of Rs 297 crore, a sharp turnaround from a loss of Rs 64 crore two years earlier.Brokerage Nirmal Bang said Lenskart’s “resilient business model” benefits from its centralized manufacturing and expanding international footprint. “Lenskart enjoys strong competitiveness in the Indian eyewear market by leveraging innovation, technology, and an omnichannel strategy that keeps it cost-efficient in a fragmented industry,” the brokerage said.Despite the subdued GMP, analysts said Lenskart remains a long-term play on India’s eyewear revolution. Its debut may not dazzle on Day One, but investors will be watching whether the company’s execution, and its ability to defend premium valuations, can keep the sparkle alive on Dalal Street (Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.

When stock markets resume trading on Monday, a host of important domestic and global events lined-up during the holiday-truncated week are likely to have an impact.On Friday, Nifty closed 17.40 points or 0.07% lower to end the day at 25,492.30.Commenting on the current Nifty trends, Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities said that Nifty has been trading below the 50EMA, indicating near-term weakness. The index has been declining since forming a double top around 26,100 on the hourly timeframe, he added.“Recently, the index slipped below a critical moving average, setting a deeper bearish tone. The crucial resistance is placed at 25,600; as long as it remains below this level, sentiment may continue to favor a sell-on-rise strategy. On the lower end, support is placed at 25,400, and a fall below this level might further boost the bears’ morale,” De said.Factors that are likely to impact movement when markets reopen this week:The earnings season will move to the final leg this week with more than 2,500 BSE listed companies announcing their results. In the Nifty pack, are Bajaj Finance, Bajaj Finserv, Tata Steel and Eicher Motors.Among the non-Nifty companies that are widely tracked are Vodafone Idea, Fortis Healthcare, Hero MotoCorp, Reliance Infrastructure, Rail Vikas Nigam (RVNL), Tata Power Company, Cochin Shipyard, Honasa Consumer (mamaearth), Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation, Nazara Technologies, SpiceJet, Brainbees Solutions (Firstcry) and Asian Paints.The Nasdaq ended slightly lower on Friday while registering its biggest weekly percentage drop since early April as fears about the sustainability of the AI-led rally weighed on Wall Street.The Nasdaq Composite closed at 23,004.50, down 49.46 points 0.22%. Meanwhile, Dow 30 ended the session at 46,987.10, gaining 74.80 points or 0.16% and the S&P 500 settled at 6,728.80, up by 8.48 points or 0.13%.Domestic and global markets are likely to take their cues from US markets.The fireworks in primary markets will continue this week as well with four mainboard issues hitting the Street viz. PhysicsWallah IPO, Tenneco Clean Air India IPO, Emmvee Photovoltaic Power IPO and Fujiyama Power Systems IPO. Meanwhile, bidding for Pine Labs will conclude on Tuesday.In the SME segment, public issues of Workmates Core2Cloud Solution and Mahamaya Lifesciences will be launched. The ongoing issues of Finbud Financial Services, Shining Tools and Curis Lifesciences will also close this week.Lenskart Solutions shares will get listed on Monday while those of Billionbrains Garage Ventures IPO (Groww IPO) will likely make their debut on Wednesday, November 12.Plenty of important corporate actions are lined-up this week with over 60 companies holding record dates for the purpose of interim dividends, bonus issue, buyback, spin-off and stock splits.Infosys shares are expected to be in action ahead of the November 14 record date for the buyback of shares. November 14, will also be the record date for the 1:10 stock split of Websol Energy System and 1:1 bonus issue of SMC Global Securities.November 11, Tuesday will be the record date for interim dividends of Garden Reach Shipbuilders & Engineers (GRSE), Nuvama Wealth Management.November 12 will be the record date for the spin-off of Allcargo Logistics.Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) turned net buyers in the holiday-shortened last week as they sold Indian equities to the tune of Rs 401 crore this week, thanks to the Friday purchases of Rs 4,581.34 crore. Meanwhile, the Domestic Institutional Investors (DIIs) were net buyers at Rs 6,674.77 crore.Also Read: Hot on AI, FIIs dump Indian equities worth Rs 1.5 lakh crore in 2025 so far. Can bubble fears reverse trends? Decoding the Nifty strength on charts, Nilesh Jain, Head – Technical and Derivatives Research Analyst at Centrum Broking said that the index has been making lower highs and lower lows since forming a double top near the 26,100 level.\"Currently, it is undergoing a retracement of the entire rally seen during the October series, with the 50% retracement level at 25,350 already tested. The next key support lies near 25,160, corresponding to the 61.8% golden retracement level. Momentum indicators and oscillators have turned negative on the daily chart with a sell crossover, although they continue to remain in buy mode on the weekly chart,\" Jain said. In his view, Nifty is approaching a crucial support zone, where a rebound could be expected making it a 'buy on dips trade as long as Nifty holds above 25,160. A decisive move above 25,700 would provide a bullish confirmation for further upside towards 26,000, he added.Also Read: Market wrap: Red reigns on D-Street as 347 of BSE 500 stocks see up to 12% WoW fall. IT, power scrips among worst hit The Indian rupee dipped on Friday but held above its record low and ended slightly higher on the week as frequent interventions by the Reserve Bank of India supported the currency in the face of outflows and persistent dollar demand from importers. It settled at 88.66 against the U.S. dollar, down from its close at 88.6125 in the previous session. On the week, though, the currency edged up by 0.1%.Portfolio outflows on account of a large equity stake sale alongside a broadly firmer dollar weighed on the rupee on Friday, while traders flagged dollar sales by state-run banks near the 88.70 mark that helped limit the currency's fall.Ongoing uncertainty on U.S.-India trade negotiations is likely to keep the rupee under pressure, analysts at Goldman Sachs said in a note. \"Even if trade uncertainty is reduced, we think the RBI will replenish its FX reserves on dips in USD/INR,\" the note added.(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.
