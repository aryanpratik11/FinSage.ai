Don’t make the same mistake, learn about both here.\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is advancing rapidly, but it faces significant constraints in power availability and physical space for data centers. While there are abundant graphics processing units (GPUs) available from Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), the real bottleneck lies in securing affordable, reliable energy to power them and the infrastructure to house them efficiently.\n\nThis creates opportunities for companies that specialize in converting low-cost power into high-utilization compute resources for AI workloads. Three stocks stand out for their ability to address these issues: Nebius Group (NASDAQ:NBIS), IREN (NASDAQ:IREN), and Cipher Mining (NASDAQ:CIFR).\n\nBy focusing on efficient data centers, vertical integration, and leased infrastructure, these firms position themselves as key enablers in the AI ecosystem, potentially driving growth as demand for compute surges.\n\nNebius Group (NBIS)\n\nNebius Group leads as a comprehensive AI utility provider, emphasizing pre-sold capacity that generates revenue before construction even starts. This approach minimizes risks and ensures steady cash flow, as its recent five-year, $17 billion deal with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) underscores, as it locks in multi-year contracts.\n\nThe company's data centers operate about 20% more power-efficiently than standard cloud facilities, reducing operational costs where energy can account for over 40% of expenses. This efficiency allows Nebius to undercut competitors like Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) AWS or even Microsoft's Azure while preserving higher margins.\n\nWhat sets Nebius apart is its software integration, offering tools like ClickHouse for data management and MLOps pipelines alongside compute resources. This creates a sticky platform where developers face high switching costs once deployed. The result is a synergistic model: affordable energy, optimized hardware, and embedded software tools reinforce one another, blending energy-like stability with software growth potential.",

        "content": "How the outsourcing sector became South Africa's newest goldmine\n\n22 October 2025 Share Save MaryLou Costa Business reporter Share Save\n\nVentrica South Africa's outsourcing sector, including accountancy support and call centres, is growing strongly\n\nEsethu Dywili says his lucrative accountancy work has given him the chance to change his family's life. The 31-year-old has spent a number of years working in South Africa's fast-growing outsourced financial services sector. An outsourced services company is one, often based in a poorer country, which does work for other businesses, typically big firms in Europe and North America. Examples include call-centres in the Philippines, IT operations in India, and South African companies that offer auditing and other finance work. Back in 2022, Mr Dywili had earned enough money to build a new house for his parents and siblings. They live in a village in the country's Eastern Cape province, an 11-hour drive from Johannesburg, where Mr Dywili now resides. \"When you work for a firm that earns its revenue in US dollars or British pounds, they are able to pay competitive salaries that perhaps you would not get working for a local South African company,\" says Mr Dywili, who has a degree in commerce and accounting.\n\nCarving out a career in South Africa's booming outsourced services industry is not something to be taken lightly when you consider the country's unemployment rate is around 33%, one of the highest in the world. South Africa's growing popularity as an outsourcing destination has been fueled by a number of factors. Firms in countries such as the UK have been moving work abroad due to both a drive to cut costs, and a reported lack of available UK staff in sectors such as accountancy. With salaries in South Africa around half of those in the UK, the country's outsourced services industry has developed a niche in financial services, along with IT and software development, data analytics and digital marketing. English language proficiency, a high level of education, and a time difference of just one or two hours with the UK also appeal to big companies. \"There's just such a great work ethic in South Africa, and an energy about South Africans,\" says Simon Wheeler, a Durban-based chartered accountant who also works in the sector. \"We're go-getters and give 110% to everything. So South Africans are really grabbing these opportunities with both hands, and taking full advantage of them. \"It now gives them that opportunity to take their career to new heights, and get that experience whilst in the country, as traditionally, it always used to be that you would have to relocate outside of South Africa to get that international experience.\"\n\nEsethu Dywili Accountant Esethu Dywili has earned enough to build his parents a new home\n\nThe outsourcing sector now contributes 35bn rand ($2bn; £1.5bn) to the South African economy per year, according to figures from the Western Cape regional government. Nezaam Joseph is chief director in the Department of Economic Development for the Western Cape government, where around 60 outsourcing firms are based. The department has been one of the earliest supporters of the sector, says Mr Joseph. Around six years ago, it began offering outsourced services firms in the province 3,500 South African rand per month, as part of a subsidised training programme for around 4,500 people a year. It says that around 80% of those people have gone on to be hired by firms full time. Mr Joseph says that more than 70,000 people are now employed in the Cape to service the outsourced needs of overseas companies. \"We added about 10,000 jobs last year, and another 10,000 plus jobs this year. Fifteen years ago, we had less than 2,000 offshore jobs.\"\n\nUK accountancy firm Cooper Parry is one British company that has outsourced work to South Africa. It turned to South African outsourcing finance firms Makosi and PKF Octagon to fill hundreds of roles during the Covid-19 pandemic. Gemma Edwards, a partner at Cooper Parry and its head of transformation and business services, says the company was so impressed with its South African partners that it recently opened an office of its own in the country. This now has 60 team members, including both Mr Dywili and Mr Wheeler. Ms Edwards says the South African employees \"have become an extension of our UK teams\". She adds: \"They join the same calls as us… it's not them and us - we're one global team.\" UK call-centre firm Ventrica, which works with brands such as shoemaker Clarks and McDonald's, opened an operation in South Africa in 2022. Around 30% of its workforce is now based there, with plans to grow this to 40%. Ventrica's chief executive Iain Banks says that its cost-conscious clients are happy for their call-centre operations to be based in South Africa, while others believe that their business is safer remaining in the UK. \"For example, there's a FMCG [fast-moving consumer goods] brand we move with,\" says Mr Banks. \"And if I were to embark on a conversation about South Africa, they would march out the door straight away.\" That may change though, as more and more highly educated South Africans enter the industry. That is certainly what Mr Joseph anticipates, as the Western Cape government plans to work more closely with universities to make curriculums a better fit for what outsourcing industry employers need.\n\nCooper Parry Gemma Edwards says her firm was so impressed by South African workers that it set up its own base there\n\nBut Jee-A van der Linde, a Cape Town-based senior economist, is concerned that, despite those ambitions, the South African education system isn't going to be able to keep pace with the outsourcing industry's growth, both in size and in importance to the country. \"The quality of education, from a social perspective, is one of the biggest hindrances for the South African economy, and a big reason for the skills deficit that we have in South Africa,\" he says. He's also concerned that not all opportunities in the South African outsourcing industry are being spread equally across the country. While many jobs could be done remotely, unstable internet connections in rural areas would rule this out. \"South Africa is a relatively big country,\" adds Mr van der Linde. \"You have your major hubs like Johannesburg and Durban, but there are gaps in how different parties govern different provinces. Some have a more business-friendly mindset. \"With those disparities, it's natural you'll likely end up with an imbalance in terms of how the outsourcing industry can actually impact unemployment across the whole country.\"",

But his first year in office has not lived up to this populist platform. Rather, his ambitious pledges have been confronted by the realities of South East Asia's biggest economy. A frustrated youth, worried about jobs, took to the streets in late August to protest against the rising cost of living, corruption and inequality - the government was forced to roll back the perks for politicians that had triggered public fury. There had been huge protests earlier in the year too, against budget cuts that hit healthcare and education spending. What didn't help was that this coincided with an expensive free school meals programme - at an annual cost of $28bn (£20.8bn). A centrepiece of Prabowo's agenda, it aims to tackle child malnutrition, improve education outcomes and stimulate the economy. Officials describe it as \"an investment in Indonesia's future.\" Except, in recent months images have emerged showing weak, dehydrated children - some as young as seven - hooked up to intravenous drips. They were suffering from food poisoning after eating the free lunches With more than 9,000 children falling ill since the scheme was rolled out in January, critics are questioning whether it's delivering at all, or straining public resources while racking up debt. Analysts warn all of these challenges highlight broader issues in public spending and oversight - and those, in turn, point to deeper strains in Indonesia's $1.4tn economy.\n\nDiscontent on the streets\n\nIt is a critical time for the vast archipelago of more than 280 million people, spread across thousands of islands. Despite steady annual growth of roughly 5% in recent years, Indonesia is feeling the pressure of slowing global demand, rising living costs and competition from regional neighbours like Vietnam and Malaysia. Both of those countries have successfully attracted foreign companies trying to diversify production away from China. The protests in August, which left 10 people dead, captured the extent of public anger over Prabowo's government. Demonstrators accused it of prioritising prestige policies and projects over providing economic support. Prabowo - who has set an ambitious growth target of 8% by 2029 - and his ministers continue to defend their policies, saying they will create jobs and stimulate demand. \"We have an experience of growing beyond 7%. So... Indonesia knows that higher growth is achievable. But of course, we have to see the global economics and the global trade,\" Indonesia's Coordinating Minister for Economic Affairs Airlangga Hartarto told the BBC. Experts say that achieving such growth will require careful management of public finances and foreign investment. A new sovereign wealth fund, Danantara, which is targeting high-impact projects across renewable energy and advanced manufacturing could spur higher growth, said Adam Samdin from advisory firm Oxford Economics.\n\nGetty Images Questions have been raised about President Prabowo Subianto's flagship free school meals plan\n\nAirlangga told the BBC that Indonesia is \"ready\" and willing to \"spend on the right sector of the economy\". But ambitious and challenging commitments like the free school meals programme make some question Prabowo's priorities. Some health-focused non-governmental organisations are urging him to stop the scheme. He defended it last month, saying \"Brazil needed 11 years to reach 47 million beneficiaries. We've reached 30 million in 11 months. We're quite proud of what we've achieved.\" Another example is India, which has the world's biggest school lunch programme, feeding nearly 120 million students. But unlike in Brazil and India, the Indonesian programme has been accused of being ineffective, despite its much higher cost, because of the mass food poisonings. Indonesia faces unique challenges. It doesn't have the infrastructure for safe and speedy meal delivery to schools across its 6,000 inhabited islands, Mr Samdin said. That includes proper refrigeration transport, as well as strict food safety standards and resources to enforce them to keep food fresh in the tropical heat. So the government is relying on third parties and contractors for the programme, which makes it even harder to monitor quality. But a flagship programme that is faltering is not Prabowo's only challenge.\n\nThe search for investment\n\nUS President Donald Trump's trade war has not spared Indonesia, which now faces 19% tariffs on exports to America. Airlangga, who was involved in the negotiations, said he was grateful for a tariff rate that could compete with rivals like Thailand, Malaysia and the Philippines, and that he expected the US-Indonesia trade deal to be signed by the end of October. But 19% is still a high cost for exporters who will also face pressure from Chinese goods being redirected to Asia to avoid high tariffs in Europe and the US. Indonesia - which is on the search for new markets and partners - also signed a trade deal last month with the European Union, which it had been negotiating for almost 10 years. Airlangga expects trade with the bloc to increase by two and a half times over the next five years. But investment, which has spurred manufacturing and created jobs in countries like Thailand and Vietnam, has become a challenge here. Foreign companies have long complained of red tape and the cost of doing business in Indonesia, but they still came because of the large consumer base and resources. It is flush with nickel and copper, which are integral to electric vehicles and other green technology, and palm oil. But these were not industries that required huge manpower, which meant they never created jobs on the same scale as manufacturing did in countries like China and Vietnam. Airlangga said Indonesia is now investing in the digital economy to create more jobs and boost growth. But whether it can provide enough people with the right skills to staff data centres and other such ventures is the big question.\n\nGetty Images Sri Mulyani Indrawati was respected for her control over government funds",

Ltd.According to Choksey, the second half of FY26 is expected to deliver stronger growth for several sectors, with banks among the prime beneficiaries. “Most of the companies, including the banking sector that you have mentioned, are definitely confirming that the second half of the financial year is definitely working out better for them compared to the first and second quarter,” he told ET Now.He noted that improved cost management and better loan traction are aiding optimism within financials. “Few reasons on the banking side particularly the liability side is coming…, the cost is under control, which is a lower cost of funds they would be getting and enjoying. On the other side, they are getting the larger amount of traction in the form of MSME and SME loans , which was probably not the scenario in the first two quarters,” he added.Highlighting the improving momentum in private sector lenders, Choksey said valuations remain attractive given the expected growth trajectory. “Most of the banks are available today at a valuation which is not expensive, given the kind of 15% kind of underlying growth promise that we carry in those companies,” he noted.The market veteran also expects renewed interest in public sector banks (PSBs), citing both valuation comfort and strong government intent. “From a valuation perspective, yes, they are undervalued. On a business case basis, the tailwind is largely coming in from the government's intention to consolidate some of the public sector banks further… the second round of consolidation is likely to happen now in this particular period 25-26,” Choksey said.He believes the ongoing earnings season has been better than anticipated. “Most of the companies have reported better profitability than anticipated, including the largecaps and among the midcaps as well,” he pointed out, adding that the combination of cost control, improving topline, and stable interest costs is setting the stage for a stronger FY26.Choksey concluded that PSU banks , backed by solid fundamentals and consolidation tailwinds, offer relatively lower downside risk. “If one has to take some position with a relatively low downside risk, I think that the PSBs are right in the checkbox list,” he said.: Recommendations, suggestions, views, and opinions expressed by experts are their own and do not represent the views of The Economic Times.)",

        "summary": "India's economy is set for a strong revival in FY26. Projections indicate growth nearing 7 percent. This surge is fueled by significant tax reductions, increased government infrastructure investment, and supportive monetary policy. Early indicators point to improved company earnings, particularly within the small and midcap segments. Discretionary spending is expected to rise, benefiting sectors like autos and appliances.",
        "content": "Live Events\n\n\n\nas a Reliable and Trusted News Source Addas a Reliable and Trusted News Source Add Now!\n\n(You can now subscribe to our\n\n(You can now subscribe to our ETMarkets WhatsApp channel\n\nEven as Indian equities remain range-bound with the Nifty slipping nearly 1% for the week, optimism about the broader economy and earnings revival is building up. According to Varun Goel , Head of Investments at Nippon India Mutual Fund , the current earnings season has been “in line or slightly ahead of expectations,” setting the stage for a potential turnaround across sectors.“For FY26, there is clearly an economic uptick that we are seeing. Thanks to the three lakh crores of tax cuts, a significant revival in central government infrastructure spending, and a very supportive and accommodative monetary policy, these three things should take the economic growth closer to 7% this year,” Goel told ET Now.He highlighted that after four quarters of downgrades, this is the first quarter showing early signs of earnings improvement — especially in the small and midcap space. “We are beginning to see earnings getting better. And as far as the small and the midcap space is concerned, the turnaround may be even better there,” he said.Goel also emphasised a realistic approach to market expectations. “If we look at the 30-year average earnings growth for Nifty 50, that has been more like 11 odd percent, and if you see the returns, that has also been more or less on those lines,” he said, adding that markets typically mirror earnings trends.On the consumption outlook, Goel expects a strong revival driven by fiscal support. “As far as discretionary consumption is concerned, that will definitely get a boost from the one lakh crores of tax cuts, two lakh crores of GST cuts, and then the third instalment of that will be the eighth pay commission,” he said, identifying autos, appliances, and travel as key beneficiaries.He remains constructive on real estate and metals, citing favourable policy support and steady demand. “We remain constructive in the sector as a whole… safeguard duties in India will ensure that the profitability of some of the steel companies will remain quite robust,” Goel noted.Also read: IPO frenzy turning murky amid lack of transparency, says market veteran Sandip Sabharwal Looking ahead, Goel expects stable inflation, strong GDP growth, and a revival in smallcap earnings to drive sentiment. “The bigger turnaround seems to be in the smallcap space… we are expecting a complete turnaround with the plus 15% plus kind of earnings growth,” he added.",

Yet, as Shah pointed out, it already stands as the only major economy where foreigners hold majority stakes in the largest listed companies across sectors—from banking and automobiles to telecom, FMCG, and asset management. The nation, unlike China, freely allows platforms like Meta, Google, X, and Amazon to operate, reflecting its confidence in openness and competition.Investment flows, too, tell a tale of promise and patience. India drew $81 billion in FDI last fiscal—about 5% of global inflows. Yet over 25 years, its net gold imports have crossed $500 billion, quietly turning it into a “capital exporter” of sorts, as Shah noted, a testament to both its consumption appetite and wealth creation.India’s technological landscape, he said, is a study in contrasts. The country still relies on foreign partnerships for advanced jet engines, but homegrown pioneers like Agnikul Cosmos are rewriting the rules—building the world’s largest single-piece 3D-printed rocket engine. ISRO, on a modest budget, has soft-landed at the Moon’s South Pole and launched 104 satellites in a single mission—an unmatched global feat.In artificial intelligence, India lacks its own large-scale foundational model, yet its telecom giants Jio and Airtel have opened global partnerships that make AI accessible to 800 million people. From this democratisation have emerged open-source wonders like Maya-1 and Luna—voice AIs that speak and sing with humanlike emotion.In healthcare, Shah highlighted the irony of shortage and abundance: rural India still needs hospital beds, but Hyderabad’s Genome Valley alone houses the world’s highest cluster of U.S. FDA-approved plants, with India supplying 40% of America’s generic drugs.From the Jio World Centre’s opulence to Dharavi’s resilience, Shah said, India’s beauty lies in its contradictions. “This nation cannot be captured in data or equations,” he reflected. “You must feel its chaos—because in that chaos lies creation.”In embracing this paradox, he said, “we don’t just understand India—we become part of its endless becoming.\": Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.

Only a third of millionaires use a wealth advisor for their financial planning and 1 in 5 plan to fire their advisor due to high costs and poor service, according to a new survey from Long Angle, the professional network for startup founders and CEOs. Among those who do use an advisor, 26% are considering switching and 18% may stop using an advisor altogether. By contrast, millionaires are highly satisfied with their personal trainers, therapists and other professionals who help with their overall wellness and family care, rather than financial issues. \"Improving your balance sheet or bank account doesn't deliver the same emotional value as improving your health and family life,\" said Chris Bendtsen, market intelligence lead at Long Angle. \"Services for personal well-being or your children score the highest.\" The results highlight the growing importance of so-called \"soft services\" for the wealthy, as wealth managers, private banks and other firms look to attract and retain more high-net-worth clients.

Personal services, child care and education ranked at the top for satisfaction. Out of a score of 1 to 10, millionaires surveyed gave their personal trainers an average score of 9.3, the highest satisfaction for any category of service.

Several digital health companies similarly offer prescriptions for GLP-1s, and the manufacturers of those drugs, Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk, are taking steps to make their treatments more accessible while also developing new ones for patients.\n\n\"The announcement is in response to our belief that access to GLP-1s will grow pretty significantly over time,\" Omada co-founder and CEO Sean Duffy said in an interview. He said Omada recognizes that the market will expand beyond GLP-1 injections to pills and other \"next-generation\" treatments that work in different ways, underscoring the need to help patients manage their medications.\n\nPrograms from companies like Omada aim to support lifestyle and behavioral changes for patients on those drugs, offering nutrition guidance, education and a team of health coaches and exercise specialists, among other resources, that can help people stay on the drugs longer. But Omada is now tapping licensed providers trained in obesity care to prescribe medications and help patients manage the drugs.\n\nThe new offering will allow the company to support patients as they receive a prescription and through the time they spend on a GLP-1. That kind of support is crucial, as GLP-1 injections can be complicated for patients to use properly and often come with gastrointestinal side effects that force some people to stop treatment.\n\n\"If you need to go up in dose, down in those, switch medications – you name it. We'll be able to support you through this experience,\" Duffy said.\n\nOmada, which partners with national and regional health plans and employers, also said the new offering is an add-on for customers to better support their workers' health needs while controlling costs and improving results from obesity treatments.\n\nAlso on Thursday, Omada Health reported quarterly earnings for the second time since its initial public offering in June.\n\nThe company, founded in 2011, offers virtual care programs to support patients with chronic conditions such as prediabetes, diabetes and hypertension. Omada describes its approach as a \"between-visit care model\" that is complementary to the broader health-care ecosystem.",

Industrial outdoor storage (IOS) is suddenly seeing significant demand and rent growth amid lean supply.\n\nIOS comprises all types of either paved or gravel land where companies can park construction equipment, vehicles, containers, supplies, really anything that can be stored outside.

It can have a structure on it, but the designation requires that structure be less than 25% of the overall space.\n\nThese sites are often located near highways, ports and other key infrastructure, but are now becoming essential staging grounds for data center construction. Developers are parking millions of dollars' worth of generators, tractors and other critical equipment, according to Alterra IOS, a prominent player in the space that has acquired over 400 sites nationwide.\n\n\"It's the real estate hiding in plain sight,\" said Leo Addimando, CEO of Alterra IOS. \"There is over a trillion dollars of IOS real estate in the U.S., but most of that is municipally, government-owned. It's the shipyard, it's the airport. There's about $300 billion of it, which is owned by mostly small local owners that own businesses, not institutional, and that's the addressable market.\"\n\nThe sector was once considered a mom-and-pop-dominated corner of the CRE market, but it is now attracting big investment from big names. In August, Zenith IOS formed a $700 million joint venture with institutional investors advised by J.P. Morgan Asset Management, for IOS properties nationwide.

        "content": "Pedestrians carry Cava bags along Wall Street near the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, US, on Monday, Aug. 18, 2025.\n\nCava on Tuesday cut its full-year forecast for the second straight quarter as younger consumers visit its restaurants less frequently.\n\n\"When you look at different age demographics of fast casual, the 25- to 34-year-old consumer seems to be impacted a bit more than others, and fast casual tends to have a higher concentration of those consumers within their guest portfolio,\" CFO Tricia Tolivar said in an interview, adding that the company saw demand fall as it entered the final quarter of the year.\n\nShe attributed the pullback from younger consumers to the demographic's higher unemployment rate, plus a higher likelihood of facing the student loan repayments that resumed in the spring. Moreover, tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump \"created an overall fog for the consumer,\" according to Tolivar.\n\nFast-casual rival Chipotle Mexican Grill reported similar behavior from the same age cohort when it released its third-quarter earnings on Wednesday.\n\nFor 2025, Cava is now projecting that its same-store sales will increase 3% to 4%, down from its prior outlook of 4% to 6% growth. The company also expects lower restaurant-level profit margins, decreasing its projections to a range of 24.4% to 24.8%, down from the previous forecast of 24.8% to 25.2%.\n\nCava shares fell 5% in extended trading. As of Tuesday's close, the stock has tumbled 54% this year.\n\nHere's what the company reported for the quarter ended Oct. 5 compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:\n\nEarnings per share: 12 cents adjusted, in line with expectations\n\nRevenue: $292.2 million vs. $292.6 million expected\n\nCava's same-store sales rose 1.9%, falling short of Wall Street's expectations of 2.8%, according to StreetAccount estimates. The chain's traffic was flat compared with the year-ago period, but menu price increases and a higher mix of premium protein options boosted sales.\n\nDespite slower same-store sales growth, Cava is gaining market share, according to Tolivar. That fact suggests that consumers who are 25- to 34-years old may be cooking at home or packing their lunches, rather than trading down to fast food.\n\n\"It appears that the consumer is being more thoughtful around their dining occasions, and how frequently they are doing that,\" Tolivar said.\n\nUnlike Chipotle and the broader restaurant industry, Cava is seeing higher same-store sales growth from low-income consumers; Tolivar credited the chain's choice to keep its menu prices below inflation, presenting a more affordable option for budget-conscious consumers.\n\nCava's net sales climbed 20% to $292.2 million, fueled by new restaurant openings. Since the third quarter of last year, Cava has opened a net 74 locations, bringing its total footprint up to 415, as of Oct. 5.\n\nThe Mediterranean chain reported fiscal third-quarter net income of $14.7 million, or 12 cents per share, down from $18 million, or 15 cents per share, a year earlier.\n\nExcluding executive transition costs and other items, Cava earned 12 cents per share.",
